# BackInStock

Have you ever missed out on your long awaited product? Do you ever find yourself constantly refreshing your browser waiting for the item to come back? Well I have, and it sucks. I hope this App can solve that problem for you.

How it works:
This app is very simple. Add the item you wish to monitor to the app using the add button. The app will check the availability of the item roughly every 15 minute and notify you if the item is back in stock. Clicking the notification will bring you back to the app, simply tap your item and it will bring you to the product page. Got your item? Nice. Now to remove the item, simplify hold the item and a message will prompt you to delete the item. 

Supports:
Currently it only supports Amazon products. Future updates will bring support for other sites.
